Beat the eggs in an electric mixer on high speed for 8 – 10 minutes, until they are light and fluffy.  While the eggs are beating place the hazelnuts in a single layer on a flat tray and toast in the oven for 5 -6  minutes. Take out of the oven and place on a tea towel. Wrap up the nuts and then rub vigorously with your hands to remove the skins. Roughly chop the nuts and set aside. In a small saucepan gently heat the Nutella until it is softened and a little runny. While still beating, add the Nutella to the egg mixture along with the salt, and beat for another minute. Fold in the flour and frozen raspberries. Pour into the baking tin and smooth the surface gently. Sprinkle over the toasted hazelnuts and bake in the oven for 35 – 40 minutes until firm. Cool in the tin before slicing into squares. The brownies are very gooey so have patience and don’t try to slice them when they are hot. Before serving scatter over some fresh raspberries. Fabulous with a dollop of thick cream and a cup of coffee. The brownies will keep in the fridge for a few days, but take out of the fridge about half an hour before serving so they can get to room temperature.",
